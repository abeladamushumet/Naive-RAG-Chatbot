# Naive-RAG-Chatbot
A Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot that answers user questions based on custom documents. It features document ingestion, embedding with SentenceTransformers, vector storage in ChromaDB, and grounded answer generation via an LLM, all orchestrated with LangChain and presented through a Gradio web UI.
